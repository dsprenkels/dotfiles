Version 1.12 Release Notes
**************************

Most of the changes in 1.12 are accumulated bug fixes, but a few features made
it in as well.

Runtime Bell
============

A new feature, similar to the displayed last command runtime, is to ring the
terminal bell when the running command exits, if the runtime was over a
threshold. This can be used to notify when a long running command has finished.

See the :attr:`LP_ENABLE_RUNTIME_BELL` and :attr:`LP_RUNTIME_BELL_THRESHOLD`
config options.

Permissions Mark
================

The ``:`` mark between the hostname and the current directory was a constant
string, but now it has a config option: :attr:`LP_MARK_PERM`.

Preset Color Aliases
====================

The ``5`` value of the basic colors is often named "magenta", but in
Liquidprompt it has always been "purple", and the bold version is "pink".

To make the options more standard, an alias for ``PURPLE`` is ``MAGENTA``, and
``PINK`` now has aliases of ``BOLD_PURPLE`` and ``BOLD_MAGENTA``.

Speed Improvements
==================

Improvements to the startup process have cut startup times by at least 30% in
all cases.
