# liquidprompt/contrib Policy

This directory contains files that have been contributed by contributors
but that the core Liquidprompt maintainers do not maintain.
So they are probably outdated and possibly poor quality (because the maintainers
may not have the knowledge to properly review them).

So use them at your own risk, and do not open issues about them, just send
patches.

## Contributing

First check the project [Contributing document](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Second, make sure you include documentation with what you are adding. Just
because we hold the content of this directory to a lower standard does not mean
we allow missing documentation. Add a README.md file to the top-level directory
that you are adding.

Lastly, if you would like to voluteer as the maintainer for some content in
here, please clearly document that in the README for your content. Make sure to
add how you would like to be contacted: via email, Github issue, or whatever
else.
